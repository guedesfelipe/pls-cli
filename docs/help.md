Do you like **PLS-CLI**?

Would you like to help **PLS-CLI**, other users, and the author?

Or would you like to get help with **PLS-CLI**?

There are very simple ways to help (several involve just one or two clicks).

And there are several ways to get help too.

## ⭐️ **PLS-CLI** in GitHub

You can "star" in GitHub (clicking in the star button at the top right):
<a href="https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli" target="_blank">https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli</a>.

## 👀 Watch the GitHub repository for releases

You can "watch" **PLS-CLI** in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right):

<a href="https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli" target="_blank">https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli</a>.

There you can select "Custom -> Releases".

By doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a new release (a new version) of **PLS-CLI** with bug fixes and new features.

## 🔭 Watch the GitHub repository

You can "watch" **PLS-CLI** in GitHub (clicking the "watch" button at the top right):

<a href="https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli" target="_blank">https://github.com/guedesfelipe/pls-cli</a>.

If you select "Watching" instead of "Releases only" you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue.

Then you can try to help them solve those issues.

## 🆘 Help others with issues in GitHub

You can see existing issues and try to help others, most of the times they are questions that you might already know the answer for. 🤓

You can create a new issue in the GitHub repository, for example to:

* Ask a **question** or ask about a **problem**.
* Suggest a new **feature**.

## 🎨 Creating themes

You can also financially support the author (me) through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/guedesfelipe" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a>.

There you could help keep this project alive and thriving. 😄
